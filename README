NODESERVER 
==========

This is the simplest node server that can be made. It should llustrate the basic point. Starting point for the code is taken from "http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/node-js-for-beginners/".

To run it, install node and call "nodejs simplehttp.js". You can send a request to the server by opening a web browser and navigating to "localhost:8080".

The server will look for data in the request and read them in. To insert data into your request, add "?data=<your data here>" to the end of the URL in your browser.

Example: 

Enter this URL: http://localhost:080/?data="foo bar"
The server will return: Here are your data: "foo bar"
